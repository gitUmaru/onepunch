<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A prevalent issue that is abundant in modern day society is the development of medical technology that aids amputated citizens in order to attain more convenient day to day lifestyles. This technology is also relevant to the demand of detailed automation work and automates minimal human assistance in industries which in turn would decrease the amount of employees injured during their work shift. A 3D printed bionic arm modeled from scratch will be tested on a variety of tasks a typical hand would handle such as holding genuine items, pouring safe substances, and normal hand gestures. Moreover, an electromyogram will act as a biological input device detecting for electric contractions in muscle which illustrates its capacities as a medical device. These contractions will act as input for controlling servo motors that move the arm in various ways. Its mechanical component consists of a programmed Arduino with several SG90 servo motors and strings to allow the proximal, distal, and intermediate phalanges to bend. The hand is constructed to reach the 27 degrees of freedom relative to a conventional hand. In addition to the electrical component, an EMG sensor will be connected to a circuit to control the motion of the hand. The benchmarks will show its practicality for industrial and medical use.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The aim of this project was to use electromyographic signals from motor neurons by measuring action potentials in muscles to create an analog signal. Through this signal one can then map analog to digital, after rectifying data for cardiac interference and other electrical obstructions, to dictate the position of servo motors. The servo motors would then “contract” fishing wire by simply rotating which, through a clever system of pulleys, allows for full control of the arm. The acquisition of electromyography signals are attained from an electrogram which measures for electrical impulses through electrodes place on the muscle, rather the epidermal area of where the muscle would be. The electrical impulses are then amplified and rectified through an integrated circuit. These signals are then read by a microcontroller which feeds analyzed data to internal actuator, refer to Figure 1.</p>
<p>Rectification of the data is mainly done through the electromyogram circuit however this simply includes taking the absolute value of the voltage that is acquired. Post-acquisition rectification can be done to smooth out the data by statistical analysis but typically is not done in out experiment. By mapping these electrical signals on an analog scale one can increment the servo motor position in respect to muscle contraction intensity, that is to say the more intense a contraction is the more the servo will turn. Consequently, this gives the motor the ability to imitate actual biological phenomenon. Fishing wire is used as the tendons of this artificial limb, the wire is lined inside the individual phalanges and form a conveyor belt like loop that allows for contractions to clench the hand and to stretch the hand. Physical construction of the prostheses is done through plastic filament and fabricated by a 3d printer. In this way cost of manufacturing the arm is kept low and accessibility is increased. Overall, several systems are implemented together to form a coherent model of the human arm.</p>
